# Project Name: My Cookbook


## Project Dexcription: For the project I created an interactive recipe saver. With this program you can add a recipe to your "Cookbook". You can add a "type of recipe", "title", "ingredients list", and then "instructions". An automatic ID number is assigned to every recipe you add allowing for easy lookup. This program also allows for CRUD operations allowing the user to create a recipe, read, update, or delete a recipe. This program was written in C# and uses SQLite for data storage.

**Task/Week 5: 
- Final Touches - Ensured everything worked properly, ran a some tests to ensure all the CRUD operations worked properly.
- Updated README file
- Uploaded finalized project to GitHub.
